# Interactive Taylor Series 

This project is based off of the paper that I wrote included in this 
repository (called e^x.pdf) that gives a very in-depth approach to 
understanding Taylor Series approximations. The paper builds an understanding
from the bottom up, making it understandable to anyone who has the slightest
exposure to basic calculus. The python project uses the MatPlotLib library
to plot an interactive Taylor Series graph for a few elementary functions.
